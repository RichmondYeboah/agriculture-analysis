## agriculture-analysis

As I ventured into the agricultural sector to explore investment opportunities, I found myself faced with a daunting task of analyzing vast amounts of data. In my journey to make data-driven decisions, I turned to Tableau to guide me through the landscape of agricultural data. Tableau is a visual analytics platform for visualization and storytelling using data. In this project, visualizations were created using data derived from the Farm Income and Wealth Statistics Dataset released by the USDA on November 30, 2023.
